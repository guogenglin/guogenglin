### Hi there 👋

🔭Hi, I am Genglin Guo, PhD. My major is veterinary microbiology. 🌱I'm a beginner of bioinformatics, Nov 2022, I started to study python from zero. I hope I can contribute to microbiology study using bioinformatics methods. 

💬I hope that these scripts I uploaded could help those people who focus in that area. 🤔And I have to admit that these scripts are very rough and may have many problems and have big potential to update, so, if anyone could give me some advice, I will be very grateful.

👯If you are trying to do some bacteria associated analyse jobs using bioinformatics, I'd be happy to try writing some scripts to help, freely. ⚡However, I am not sure that I can solve your problem, as my skills in bioinformatics are limited.😄

BTW, now I'm looking for a job (or a postdoc position), if anyone is interested or could give me some information, please contact me asap.🙏
