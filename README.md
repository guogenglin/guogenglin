### Hi there 👋

<!--
**guogenglin/guogenglin** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

🔭Hi, I am Genglin Guo, PhD student in Nanjing Agricultural University, China. My major is veterinary microbiology. 🌱I'm a beginner of bioinformatics, Nov 2022, I started to study python from zero. I hope I can contribute to fix microbiology problems using bioinformatics methods. 

💬I hope that the scripts I uploaded to my repository could help those people who focus in that area. 🤔And I have to admit that these scripts are very rough and may have many problems and have big potential to update, so, if anyone could give me some advice, I will be very grateful.

👯If you are trying to do some bacteria associated analyse jobs using bioinformatics, I'd be happy to try writing some scripts to help, freely. ⚡However, I am not sure that I can solve your problem, as my skills in bioinformatics are limited.
😄
