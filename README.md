### Hi there 👋

🔭 Hi, I’m Genglin Guo, PhD, my major is veterinary microbiology. 🌱 I’ve always been a beginner in bioinformatics, but I’m passionate about this field and hope to contribute to microbiology research using bioinformatics approaches.

💬 I’ve uploaded some scripts that I hope will be helpful to others working in this area. 🤔I must admit that these scripts are still rough, may contain issues, and have plenty of room for improvement. I’m continuously working on refining them through further study, and I would be extremely grateful for any advice or feedback.

👯 If you’re working on bacterial genomics and need help with bioinformatics scripts, I’d be happy to try writing something to assist you—completely free of charge. ⚡ However, I should note that my bioinformatics skills are still developing, so I might not be able to solve every problem. 😄

By the way, I’m currently looking for a job or a postdoctoral position. If you’re interested or have any information, please feel free to contact me as soon as possible. 🙏
