🔭Hi, I am Genglin Guo, PhD. My major is veterinary microbiology. 🌱I'm and always been a beginner in bioinformatics, I love this area. I hope I can contribute to microbiology studies using bioinformatics methods. 

💬I hope that these scripts I uploaded can help those people who focus on that area. 🤔 I have to admit that these scripts are very rough and may have many problems and have big potential to be updated, and I am continuously working on that through further study, also, if anyone could give me some advice, I would be very grateful.

👯If you are trying to do some bacteria genomic analysis jobs using bioinformatics, I'd be happy to try writing some scripts to help, freely. ⚡However, I am not sure that I can solve your problem, as my skills in bioinformatics are limited.😄

BTW, now I'm looking for a job (or a postdoc position), if anyone is interested or could give me some information, please contact me ASAP.🙏
